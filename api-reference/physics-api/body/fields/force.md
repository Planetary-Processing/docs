# Force

`body.Force`

The combined XYZ vector of forces which have been applied to a physics body on an update. Forces from incidental factors, such as collisions, are not included in this value.

If any forces were applied within the [`init`](../../../entity-api/entity/necessary-methods/init.md) function of an entity, that Force value will also persist into the first [`update`](../../../entity-api/entity/necessary-methods/update.md) tick.



| Type                      | Initialised Value                                                                         | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`Vector`](../../vector/) | <p><code>{X = 0,</code> </p><p>    <code>Y = 0,</code> </p><p>    <code>Z = 0}</code></p> | The total force which will be applied to this entity body at the end of the update tick. |



Example:

Cap the total force that can be applied to an entity at once, regardless of how much force is applied over the course of the update.
