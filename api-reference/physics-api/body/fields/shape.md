# Shape

`body.Shape`

The bounding box which defines when the entity body has intersected or collided with another entity body.

A shape can be a [Box](../../shape/box/), defined by its X, Y, and Z dimensions. \
Or a [Sphere](../../shape/sphere/) defined by its radius.

| Type                    | Initialised Value  | Description                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| [`Shape`](../../shape/) | eg. `{1,2,3}`      | The shape of an axis-aligned bounding box.   |
|                         | eg. `{1}`          | The shape of a spherical collision boundary. |



Example:

Create a box-shaped entity body and turn it into a sphere-shaped one, or back to a box, whenever it collides with another physical entity.&#x20;

-- Turn on physics calculations for this entity.
-- Create a box shape and a body. Assign it to the entity and record the shape type.
-- On the first update apply a force to make the entity move in direction (1,1,0).
-- Record the previous velocity of the body at the end of each update.
-- Each update, check whether the direction has become inverted, since the last update.
-- If the entity has rebounded, create a new physics body of the other shape type.
-- Swap to the other physics body shape type, record the new shape type.
-- Start the new body moving, by applying the old body's velocity as a force.

-- Prints:
-- A collision has occurred. This entity was a box &#x26;{8 8 8} . It is now a sphere &#x26;{4} .

-- Or prints:
-- A collision has occurred. This entity was a sphere &#x26;{4} . It is now a box &#x26;{8 8 8} .
