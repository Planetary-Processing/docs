                            {
                                ["Content-Type"]="text/plain",
                                ["Authorisation"]="Basic YWxhZGRpbjp"},
                            "cool!")
        
        if code == 200 then
          print("Response returned successfully: "..body)
          print("Chunks have been updated.")
        else
          print("Response returned HTTP code: "..code)
        end
    end
end

-- Send a POST HTTP request to the url https://eg.mydatabase.com/chunks.
-- The endpoint url updates its data based on the request's body: "cool!"
-- The endpoint responds with some updated data about chunks.
-- The string body of the response is printed.

-- Prints (dependent on endpoint response):
-- Response returned successfully: Chunks were lame. Chunks are cool!
-- Chunks have been updated.

-- Or Prints (exact code number varies):
-- Response returned HTTP code: 404
