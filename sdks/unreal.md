# Unreal

## Introduction

Planetary Processing provides a plugin for Unreal Engine 5. The plugin consists of a number of C++ classes for use in connecting players to your game simulation, as well as communicating simulation state to your game client and messages from the client to your simulation.

### Pre-requisites

* Unreal Engine 5.4+ _<mark style="color:yellow;">(</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">**Note: the update for Unreal Engine 5.5 is still in development. Please use 5.4).**</mark>_&#x20;
* macOS or Windows, the PP Unreal plugin does not currently support Linux.

### Installation

To install the Planetary Processing plugin, you must first download the plugin files from our website, you will need to be logged into your Planetary Processing account to do so, the link is: [https://files.planetaryprocessing.io/builds/downloads/artefactid/107/version/latest/dist/dist.tar](https://files.planetaryprocessing.io/builds/downloads/artefactid/107/version/latest/dist/dist.tar)

You'll need then to extract this and move the contents of the `lib` directory into a directory called `PlanetaryProcessing` in the `Plugins` directory at the root level of your project. You'll need to create the Plugins directory if it does not already exist.

You can now enable the Planetary Processing plugin for your Unreal Engine 5 project. You will be required to restart the engine once you enable the plugin.



## Classes

### PlanetaryProcessing Class

This class is the core of the Planetary Processing plugin. It handles initialization, connection to the server, authentication, message sending, and state updates from the server. This class is intended to be used as a singleton, and instantiated via the [Init](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) static function.

### Entity Class

This class represents an [Entity](../server/entities.md) in the Planetary Processing system. It contains all the [data](unreal.md#entity-class-1) of the corresponding entity on your game server. The [Entity Types](../server/entities.md#types-and-behaviour-scripting) can be matched up with the [EntityActor](unreal.md#entityactor-class) class using the [Entity Map](unreal.md#entity-actor-spawning) variable.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/unreal_sdk_EntityFind (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



### EntityActor Class

This class extends the Unreal Engine Actor class, spawning an Actor in your game client based on an [Entity](../server/entities.md) from your game simulation. You are intended to subclass [Entity Actor](unreal.md#entity-actor-spawning) to create Actors for each of your [Entity Types](../server/entities.md#types-and-behaviour-scripting). As an example, a 'Tree' class could be an [Entity Actor](unreal.md#entity-actor-spawning) for a 'tree' [Entity Type](../server/entities.md#types-and-behaviour-scripting). Meanwhile a 'Cat' class could be a completely different [Entity Actor](unreal.md#entity-actor-spawning) with a separate mesh component and behaviours.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/unreal_sdk_EntityMap.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The [EntityActor](unreal.md#entity-actor-spawning) class is intended to have an [Entity](unreal.md#entity-class-1) associated with it once created, via [SetEntity](unreal.md#entity-actor-spawning). With this set, the [EntityActor](unreal.md#entity-actor-spawning) class will automatically broadcast [OnUpdated](unreal.md#pp_exampleentityactor) and [OnRemoved](unreal.md#pp_exampleentityactor) events accordingly, as its associated [Entity](unreal.md#entity-class-1) is either updated or removed.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/unreal_sdk_SetEntityActor.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### ChunkActor Class

Use of this class is optional. Similar to the [Entity Actor](unreal.md#entityactor-class), this class spawns an Actor in your game client. If used, an Actor is spawned at the bottom-left corner of every [Chunk](../server/chunks.md) in your game simulation.&#x20;

The main purpose of the [Chunk Actor](unreal.md#chunk-actor-spawning) is to store information, such as data about nearby terrain. In most cases the [Chunk Actor](unreal.md#chunk-actor-spawning) will not need a mesh, since it cannot move or act.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/ChunkMapAndSize.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Chunks only have one type, 'chunk'. A subclass of [Chunk Actor](unreal.md#chunk-actor-spawning) must be defined in the Chunk Map using the key 'chunk'. You must also define the Chunk Size integer variable, using the chunk size set in your [online game](https://panel.planetaryprocessing.io/games).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/SetChunk.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The ChunkActor class is intended to have an Chunk associated with it once created, via SetChunk. With this set, the ChunkActor class will automatically broadcast [OnUpdated](unreal.md#pp_exampleentityactor) and [OnRemoved](unreal.md#pp_exampleentityactor) events accordingly, as its associated Chunk is either updated or goes out of range of a Chunkloader.

### MessageData Class

The [MessageData](unreal.md#send-player-coordinates-message) class is designed to serve as a flexible container for arbitrary data, akin to JavaScript objects. Its primary purpose is twofold:

* **Deserialization from JSON:** It allows update messages received from the server in JSON format to be efficiently parsed and stored in a way that can be accessed within Unreal Engine. This ensures that the data stored on each [Entity](unreal.md#entity-class-1) (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and nested objects) can be translated into native Unreal Engine data structures.
* **Serialization to JSON:** Conversely, the class enables the construction of arbitrary data structures which can be serialized and sent to the server as the body of the message in a [SendMessage](unreal.md#send-player-coordinates-message) call.

Hence it can be used in [Blueprints](unreal.md#blueprints) to both access data on [Entity](unreal.md#entity-class-1) instances and construct messages for [SendMessage](unreal.md#send-player-coordinates-message).&#x20;

If you want to handle serialization and deserialization yourself, without [MessageData](unreal.md#send-player-coordinates-message), the original JSON of an [Entity](unreal.md#entity-class-1) is available in the [DataJSON](unreal.md#entity-class-1) property of that class. Raw JSON messages can also be sent using the [SendJSONMessage](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) function of the [PlanetaryProcessing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) class.

## Blueprints

The Planetary Processing plugin is packaged with a number of example Blueprints. These serve to show how to carry out some basic functions using the Planetary Processing plugin. These blueprints are [PP\_ExamplePlayerController](unreal.md#pp_exampleplayercontroller), [PP\_ExampleEntityActor](unreal.md#pp_exampleentityactor), and the [PP\_ExampleLoginWidget](unreal.md#pp_exampleloginwidget).

### PP\_ExamplePlayerController

This blueprint demonstrates how to initialize your [Planetary Processing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) instance and then how to carry out the fundamental processes required to make use of it. These include [establishing the connection](unreal.md#authentication), [initializing entities](unreal.md#entity-actor-spawning), [maintaining the connection](unreal.md#connection-error-handling), and [processing messages to](unreal.md#send-player-coordinates-message) and [from the server](unreal.md#update-entities).

#### Authentication

There are two stages to authentication: initializing the connection the game server and joining the validated connection's processing.

![Authentication](https://planetaryprocessing.io/static/img/unreal_authentication.png)

Initializing the connection:

1. `Event BeginPlay/Show Login ->  Init -> Set`
   * Initialize the [PlanetaryProcessing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) singleton with a Game ID (Game ID available in the [Planetary Processing Panel](https://panel.planetaryprocessing.io/)).
2. `Create PP Example Login Widget Widget -> Set -> Add to Viewport`
   * Create an instance of [PP\_ExampleLoginWidget](unreal.md#pp_exampleloginwidget) and adds it to the viewport.
3. `Planetary Processing Instance -> Bind Event to On Authenticated -> OnAuthenticated_Event`
   * Bind the connection joining processes to the [OnAuthenticated ](unreal.md#delegates)event triggered from the [PlanetaryProcessing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) singleton.

Joining a valid connection:

1. `OnAuthenticated_Event -> Delay`
   * A short delay ensures subsequent bindings are handled by the game thread.
2. `Login Widget Instance -> Remove from Parent -> Set`
   * Remove the login widget from the viewport.
3. `Unbind All Events from On Authenticated -> Planetary Processing Instance`
   * Unbind all events from the [OnAuthenticated](unreal.md#delegates) event.
4. `Planetary Processing Instance - > Bind Event to On Entity Added -> Bind Event to On Connection Error`
   * Set up bindings to generate the game server world using the [OnEntityAdded](unreal.md#entity-actor-spawning) and [OnConnectionError](unreal.md#connection-error-handling) events from the [PlanetaryProcessing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) singleton.
5. `Start Game -> Start Game (Custom Event)`
   * Continue with game logic, in this case a custom event named StartGame.



#### Entity Actor Spawning

![Entity Actor Spawning](https://planetaryprocessing.io/static/img/unreal_actor_spawning.png)

1. `OnEntityAdded_Event -> GetType / Entity Map -> Find`
   * Look up the [EntityActor](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) class reference in the [EntityMap](unreal.md#pp_exampleplayercontroller-1) variable using the [Entity Type](unreal.md#entity-class-1) from the [OnEntityAdded\_Event](unreal.md#delegates)**.**
2. `GetLocationVector -> Make Transform`
   * Use the [GetLocationVector](unreal.md#entity-class-1) function of the added [Entity](unreal.md#entity-class-1) to create a Vector for the initial location of the [EntityActor](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1).
3. `Find / Branch / Make Transform -> Spawn Actor`
   * If the [Type](unreal.md#entity-class-1) is valid, spawn an instance of the [EntityActor](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1)**.**
4. `OnEntityAdded_Event / Spawn Actor -> Set Entity`
   * Call [SetEntity](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) on the [EntityActor](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) to associate it with the [Entity](unreal.md#entity-class-1) that we are representing.

If you wish, you can extend the script to remove spawning for the client player entity. This can be done by adding an extra branch to filter entities with the same ID as the [Planetary Processing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) instance's [UUID](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1). This only removes the player's own entity from the client, not other players.

#### Chunk Actor Spawning

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/ChunkActorSpawning.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. `OnChunkAdded_Event -> Entity Map -> Find`
   * Look up the ChunkActor class reference in the ChunkMap variable using the key 'chunk'**.**
2. `GetLocationVector / Chunk Size -> Multiply -> Make Transform`
   * Use the [GetLocationVector](unreal.md#entity-class-1) function of the added Chunk to get its X and Y values. Multiply these by the Chunk Size to create a Vector for the location of the ChunkActor.
3. `Find / Branch / Make Transform -> Spawn Actor`
   * If the 'chunk' key is in use, spawn an instance of the ChunkActo&#x72;**.**
4. `OnChunkAdded_Event / Spawn Actor -> Set Chunk`
   * Call SetChunk on the ChunkActor to associate it with the Chunk that we are representing.



#### Connection Error Handling

If the connection fails, cease processing the world and return to the authentication login.

![Connection Error Handling](https://planetaryprocessing.io/static/img/unreal_error_handling.png)

1. `OnConnectionError_Event / Planetary Processing Instance -> Unbind All Events from On Entity Added / Planetary Processing Instance -> Unbind All Events from On Connection Error`
   * Unbinds all events from [OnEntityAdded](unreal.md#delegates) and [OnConnectionError](unreal.md#delegates)**.**
2. `Show Login -> Show Login Custom Event`
   * Calls a custom event called [ShowLogin](unreal.md#authentication), which feeds back into the [authentication](unreal.md#authentication) flow above.



#### Update Entities

![Update Entities](https://planetaryprocessing.io/static/img/unreal_update_entities.png)

1. `Planetary Processing Instance -> IsAuthenticated / Event Tick ->  Branch`
   * On each tick, check if the connection is authenticated by calling [IsAuthenticated](unreal.md#functions) on the [PlanetaryProcessing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) instance.
2. `Branch -> Sequence / Planetary Processing Instance -> Update -> OnUpdated_Event`
   * If it is authenticated, call the [Update](unreal.md#functions) function of the [PlanetaryProcessing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) instance to process state changes received.
3. `Sequence -> Send Player Coords -> SendPlayerCoords (Custom Event)`
   * We then also call the [SendPlayerCoords](unreal.md#send-player-coordinates-message) custom event.



#### Send Player Coordinates Message

![Send Player Coordinates Message](https://planetaryprocessing.io/static/img/unreal_send_player_coords_message.png)

1. `Send Player Coords (Custom Event) -> ...`
   * Process the message on each [update tick](unreal.md#update-entities) using the [Send Player Coords](unreal.md#update-entities) broadcast.
2. `Get Player Pawn -> Get Actor Location`
   * Get the location of the Player Pawn Actor.
3. `Convert Vector To Server Coords Message Data -> Set`
   * Call the [ConvertVectorToServerCoordsMessageData](unreal.md#functions) static function from the [PlanetaryProcessing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) class. This gives us a map of strings to MessageData values, with the x, y and z values set based on the player position. [ConvertVectorToServerCoordsMessageData](unreal.md#functions) alters these xyz values to match the Planetary Processing coordinate system orientation.
4. `Set / To MessageData (bool) -> Add`
   * Uses the implicit conversion of a boolean to [MessageData](unreal.md#messagedata-class-1) as the value for a new key of _threedee_ in our map.
5. `Add / Planetary Processing Instance / Set -> Send Message`
   * Calls [SendMessage](unreal.md#functions) on our [PlanetaryProcessing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) instance with our message map as an argument.



### PP\_ExampleEntityActor

This blueprint shows how to bind to the [OnUpdated](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) and [OnRemoved](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) events for an [EntityActor](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1).

#### Event Binding

![Entity Actor Event Binding](https://planetaryprocessing.io/static/img/unreal_entiaty_actor_binding.png)

1. `Event BeginPlay -> Bind Event to On Updated -> OnUpdated_Event -> Set Actor Location to Entity Coords`
   * Bind to the [OnUpdated](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) event for the [EntityActor](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1). Calls [SetActorLocationToEntityCoords](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) to update the Actor's location to match the [Entity](unreal.md#entity-class-1)**.**
2. `Bind Event to On Removed -> OnRemoved_Event -> Destroy Actor`
   * Bind to the [OnRemoved](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) event for the [EntityActor](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1). Destroys the Actor when this event is broadcast.

For the actor to follow the server-side location, without issue, it must have physics disabled on the clientside.

If you wish to retrieve the location vector of an entity before it is set automatically, you can use the following example. Replace the Print String function with functions of your choice.

### PP\_ExampleChunkActor

This blueprint shows how to bind to the [OnUpdated](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) and [OnRemoved](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) events for a ChunkActor.

#### Event Binding

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/ChunkActorUpdateRemove (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. `Event BeginPlay -> Bind Event to On Updated -> OnUpdated_Event -> Set Actor Location to Chunk Coords`
   * Bind to the [OnUpdated](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) event for the ChunkActor. Calls SetActorLocationToChunkCoords to update the Actor's location to match the [Entity](unreal.md#entity-class-1)**.**
2. `Bind Event to On Removed -> OnRemoved_Event -> Destroy Actor`
   * Bind to the [OnRemoved](unreal.md#entityactor-class-1) event for the ChunkActor. Destroys the Actor when this event is broadcast.



### PP\_ExampleLoginWidget

This is a simple login widget which calls the [Connect](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) function and displays an error if the connection fails.

#### Login Click

![Login Click](https://planetaryprocessing.io/static/img/unreal_login_click.png)

1. `OnClicked (Login_Button) / Error Message Text -> Set Visibility`
   * Hide the error message (effectively resetting the error state of the login form) when clicked.
2. `Username / Password -> GetText  -> Get Planetary Processing Instance / To String (Text) ->  Connect`
   * Call the [Connect](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) function on the [PlanetaryProcessing](unreal.md#planetaryprocessing-class-1) instance with the username and password from the login form.



#### Error Handling

![Login Error Handling](https://planetaryprocessing.io/static/img/unreal_login_error_handling.png)

1. `Event On Initialized -> Get Planetary Processing Instance -> Bind Event to On Connection Error -> OnConnectionError_Event`
   * Bind to the [OnConnectionError](unreal.md#delegates) event when the widget is initialized.
2. `OnConnectionError_Event / Error Message Text -> Set`
   * Set the error message to be visible when [OnConnectionError](unreal.md#delegates) is broadcast.
