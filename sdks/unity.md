# Unity

The Unity SDK integrates our multiplayer platform with Unity. The plugin provides components and methods to use within your game client code - these communicate changes in state from your server side simulation to the game client itself.

If you are new here, we recommend starting with the [Unity Quickstart Guide](../quick-start/unity.md).

## Installation

The Unity SDK can be installed by opening the Unity Package Manager (Window->Package Manager) and clicking the + on the top left and selecting 'Add package from git URL...'

![](https://planetaryprocessing.io/static/img/unity_install.png)

You then enter the GitHub URL of the PP Unity SDK repository, which is: `https://github.com/Planetary-Processing/unity-sdk.git`

And click 'Add' to add the package.

## Components

The Unity SDK provides three new components which can be added to GameObjects. These are the [Master](unity.md#master-component), [Entity](unity.md#entity-component), and [Chunk](unity.md#chunk-component) components. These can be accessed in the 'Add Component' menu of any GameObject under the 'PP' heading.

### Master Component

[PPMaster](unity.md#ppmaster) represents the main connection point to PP's servers and performs the heavy lifting and orchestration of the SDK. You must have a GameObject in your game which has the Master Component.

To configure the Master Component you will need to set some references to GameObjects and Prefabs, in the [PPMaster](unity.md#ppmaster) inspector window.&#x20;

* **Player** - Your local player will be represented by a GameObject.
* **Chunk Prefab** - A Prefab with the [Chunk Component](unity.md#chunk-component) to manage Chunks.
* **Prefabs** - Each Prefab created with the the [Entity Component ](unity.md#entity-component)must be added to the Entity 'Prefabs' list in the inspector.
* **Game ID** - The ID of your game from the [web panel](https://panel.planetaryprocessing.io/games), for Unity to connect to.
* **Chunk Size** - The size of chunks in your game, defined in the [web panel](https://panel.planetaryprocessing.io/games) game settings.
* **Two Dimensions** - Automatically adjusts entity positions to use Unity's 2D orientation.
* **Server To Client Object** - A GameObject which receives manual messages from the game [server to the client](unity.md#server-to-client-messaging).

### Entity Component

[PPEntity ](unity.md#ppentity)represents a server-side entity in the game world. You are required to, for every [type ](../server/entities.md#types-and-behaviour-scripting)of entity you wish to display in the Unity client, create a Prefab containing the [PPEntity ](unity.md#ppentity)component.

By default, entities' GameObjects will be moved to their server-side position, you can disable this per entity type by un-ticking 'Use Server Position' in the entity component's inspector window. Here you also need to set the entity's [type](../server/entities.md#types-and-behaviour-scripting), which must match the server-side type that this Prefab represents.

Please note that the `player` [type](../server/entities.md#types-and-behaviour-scripting) is needed only for other players, not the one connecting with this client. For the local player, you need to create a separate GameObject (not in a prefab). The local player also requires a PPEntity component, but not a specific [type](../server/entities.md#types-and-behaviour-scripting) definition in the inspector.

### Chunk Component

[PPChunk ](unity.md#ppchunk)represents each [chunk ](../server/chunks.md)in the game world. Each chunk has a data table, which is synced down to the client with the [PPChunk ](unity.md#ppchunk)component. To use this, you must create a Prefab with the [PPChunk ](unity.md#ppchunk)component on it, which will be instantiated at the corner of each chunk and will hold its data.

## Server To Client Messaging

The [PPEntity](unity.md#ppentity) component automatically receives and syncs all [Entity](../server/entities.md) data from the game world.

Messages can be manually sent to a specific client using [`api.client.Message()`](../api-reference/client-api/message.md). These message can be received by a designated [Server To Client Object](unity.md#master-component). This GameObject needs a custom script component, with a function named [`ServerToClient`](unity.md#custom-scripts), which receives the server message as a parameter.

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="lang-csharp"><strong>void ServerToClient(Dictionary&#x3C;string, object> message)
</strong>    {
        message.TryGetValue("key", out object value);
    }
</code></pre>



## API

Below are reference tables of the API available within Unity's C# environment.

The [PPMaster](unity.md#ppmaster), [PPEntity](unity.md#ppentity), and [PPChunk ](unity.md#ppchunk)components expose various public methods which can be accessed within MonoBehaviour scripts by getting a reference to the component like so:

```csharp
PPMaster master = GetComponent<PPMaster>();
PPEntity entity = GetComponent<PPEntity>();
PPChunk chunk = GetComponent<PPChunk>();
```

To connect to the server and join with the player, for example:

```csharp
PPMaster master = GetComponent<PPMaster>();
master.Init("", "");
master.Join();
```
